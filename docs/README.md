# Ionic Generator documentation

## Environment Specific Configuration

While building your Ionic app, you may find yourself working with multiple environments such as development, staging, and production. This generator uses [grunt-ng-constant] (https://github.com/werk85/grunt-ng-constant) to set up your workflow with development and production environment configurations right out of the box.
